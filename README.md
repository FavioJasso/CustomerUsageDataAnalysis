# CustomerUsageDataAnalysis
I used R to create a linear regression model with a single variable and multivariable analysis for Ecommerce Customer Device Usage. 

**EVALUATING THE MULTIPLE REGRESSION MODEL FINDINGS **
By using a multiple linear model, we have created a much more accuratec predictor of the response variable. 
R2 went from 0.65 to 0.98
The Root Mean Square Errorwent from 47.14 to 9.97 dollars.
